# Regex, what is it?


Regex, short for Regular Expression, is a powerful and standardized sequence of characters that form a search pattern. It's a versatile tool used in computing, particularly in text processing tasks. Regex allows for the efficient and flexible matching, searching, and manipulation of strings based on specific patterns. These patterns can include characters, numbers, whitespace, and more, enabling complex operations like finding email addresses, validating data, extracting specific content, and replacing text. Understanding regex is invaluable for developers, data analysts, and anyone dealing with textual data, as it provides a systematic approach to handle intricate string-based operations. In this tutorial, we will delve into the various components and concepts that constitute a regex, offering a detailed understanding of its functionalities and applications.

## Summary

This regex is used to validate an email address format. It ensures that the email follows the pattern of a username, followed by the "@" symbol, then a domain name, a dot, and a top-level domain (TLD). The username and domain name can consist of lowercase letters, digits, underscores, dots, or hyphens. The TLD is expected to have 2 to 6 lowercase letters or dots. Here is a snippet of what the Regex actually looks like, /^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/.

Example valid email: example123@email.com
Example invalid email: invalid.email@domain
